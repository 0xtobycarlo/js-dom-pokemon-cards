## Tips
- **Start with a single card**. Once you've got a card, think of a way to programmatically create all the others.
- If you are struggling to create the full card layout - start simple. Try render just the name of each pokemon in a `<p>` tag. Then, add the image, then the stats, etc
- Use functions to your advantage. Break each card into smaller parts, and think how you can turn them into functions.
- Make sure you understand well the data structure before starting to create the cards
